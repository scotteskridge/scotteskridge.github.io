	Writing about myself is always a little daunting. Do I talk about my work history first implying that that’s the central part of who I am? How about my family instead? Certainly, discussing religious and political views feels a little like over sharing. But at the risk of being predictable I'm going to start with my work history and go from there.

	I'm a Veteran of the Airforce with an Electrical Engineering background and I worked with the high-energy signals defensive avionics on the B1-B bomber. I've been in the mortgage and banking industry for the last 15 years and have managed and trained a team as well as owned my own brokerage. I'm married with two little girls, and while I love my children they have taught me that I do not like babies, mine or especially anyone else's.  I love games of all types but have found that I love the theory and mechanics more than the actual playing. I’m an avid bibliophile and for a while was a competitive ballroom dancer. And for party small talk I always find it’s fun to mention that I have anosmia mostly because no one else has ever met someone who is “nose-blind”. My favorite movie is "The Princess Bride". My favorite quote is from Heinlein and I’d like to think that in his words I’m a competent man:

	“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.”	
	-Robert A. Heinlein “
