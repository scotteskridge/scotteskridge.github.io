Writeing about myself is always a little duanting. Do I talk about my work history first implying that thats the central part of who I am? How about my family instead? Certainly religeous and political veiws feels a little like over sharing. But at the risk of being predictable I'm going to start with my work history and go from there.

I'm a Veteran of the Airforce with an Electrical Engineering background. I've been in the mortgage and banking industry for the last 15 years having managed and trained a team as well as owned my own brokerage. I'm married with two little girls, and while I love my children they have tuaght me that I do not like babies, mine or especially anyone else's.
